My name is Daniel Agbemava and this is my personal website/blog. 

I am Software Developer currently working at Nevercode as part of the OSE team. 
I am also a freelance software developer. 

This site is mainly for blog posts about topics I find interesting and my experience building apps 
as part of my freelance work.

I may occasionally talk about things unrelated to development, but that may be few in far between.
